<h1>The Best Movies According to Kain</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Resident evil</h3>
<p>i loved this movie because of the whole post apocaliptic world they live in, it has a lot of action and intense situations by far one of my favourites.</p>
<h3>Berserk</h3>
<p>all together this is one of my favourites because of the evil and dark story. The intense horror aspect and the heavy fighting makes this one of my favoured movies i definitely suggest giving it a watch.</p>
<h3>Aladdin</h3>
<p>i really enjoyed aladdin because of the monkey abu, he made ma laugh a lot and made the film a lot more enjoyable. i like the story and how they show the vibe of each character easily, i would definitely recommend.</p>
